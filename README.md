# Project-1: College Recruitment Improvement Study

To improve its recruitment process and increase the number of individuals in its computing classes and majors, CCM administers a survey every Fall semester for entry-level computing clases and computer literacy courses. This survey contains data on why students are taking these courses to hopefully indentify areas that recruiting areas can be focused in, especially for under-represented groups. This project analyzes the data from this survey and includes strategies on improving recruitment efforts.

### Questions focused on: 
##### How does the race/ethnicity relate to the aspects which impacted students decision to go to CCM?
##### What are the top activities or experiences which impacted students decision to enroll in a computing course at CCM?
##### What are the top ways people heard about CCM?
##### What are the top events at CCM that students participated in?
